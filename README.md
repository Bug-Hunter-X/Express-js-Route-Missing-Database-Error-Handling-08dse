# Express.js Route Missing Database Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of comprehensive error handling for database queries. The provided code correctly handles the case where a user is not found (404), but neglects to gracefully handle other potential database errors (e.g., connection issues, malformed queries).  This can lead to unexpected server crashes or inconsistent responses.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed route handler.  It successfully handles the absence of a user but does not catch and respond to other database errors, potentially resulting in unhandled promise rejections or server crashes. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected version incorporating robust error handling using try...catch blocks to manage database query exceptions and provide informative responses to the client.
